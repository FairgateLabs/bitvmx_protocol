# BitVMX Protocol Library

This directory contains the core functionalities required by both the prover and verifier in the BitVMX protocol implementation. The library offers essential services, entities, and utilities for executing the protocol.

## Contents

1. **Script Generation**: Provides services and entities for generating Bitcoin scripts utilized in the protocol.

2. **Transaction Generation**: Offers services for creating and managing transactions within the protocol.

3. **Execution**: Includes services related to the execution of the BitVMX protocol, featuring an abstraction layer for interacting with the BitVMX-CPU.

4. **Winternitz Keys Handling**: Manages Winternitz one-time signatures.

5. **Protocol Definition**: Contains entities and Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) for defining the protocol structure, along with key generation services.

## Usage

This library is employed by both the prover and verifier applications to implement the BitVMX protocol. It provides the necessary tools and services for script generation, transaction creation, key management, and blockchain interaction.

For detailed usage of specific services or entities, please refer to the respective files within the library.

## Note

This library is part of an ongoing implementation of the BitVMX protocol. Some features may be incomplete or subject to change as the project progresses.
